Q1.
Name your C++ source file \verb!q01-01.cpp!.
Write a function \verb!replaces()! that replaces a character
in a C-string with another.
For instance suppose you have
\begin{console}
char x[1024] = "helloworld";
\end{console}
If you call
\begin{console}
replace(x, 'o', 'a');
\end{console}
and then you print \verb!x!, the output is
\begin{console}
hellawarld
\end{console}
(HINT: Don't forget that C-strings must end with \verb!'\0'!.)

Here's the execution of an actual test case:
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{helloworld}
hellawarld
\end{console}

Q2.
Name your C++ source file \verb!q01-02.cpp!.
Write a function \verb!remove()! that removes a character
in a C-string.
For instance suppose you have
\begin{console}
char x[1024] = "helloworld";
\end{console}
If you call
\begin{console}
remove(x, 'o');
\end{console}
and then you print \verb!x!, the output is
\begin{console}
hellwrld
\end{console}

Here's the execution of an actual test case:
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{helloworld}
hellwrld
\end{console}
(HINT: Don't forget that C-strings must end with \verb!'\0'!.)

\textsc{Aside}
Once you are done with the above, you should write a function
\begin{console}
void replace(char x[], char y[], char z[]);
\end{console}
that replaces all substrings \verb!y! with that appear in \verb!x!
with \verb!z!.
The case when \verb!y! and \verb!z! both have string length 1
is the same as Q1 and the
case when \verb!y! has length 1 and \verb!z! has length 0
is the same as Q2.
